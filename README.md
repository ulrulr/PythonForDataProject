# PythonForDataProject


For this project, I had to study the dataset of QSAR predictions.
These are relevant data that indicate whether a chemical is biodegradable or not.

The main goal of this project was to study all the models and to indicate which one has the best result with respect to this dataset.

After several studies, I realised that the model that gave the best results was logistic regression.

I then put my model into production using Flask so that you could test it.
